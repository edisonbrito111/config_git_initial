<aside>
💡 **Notion Tip:** A good mission statement is quick, short, and sticks in people's brains. What purpose are you working toward every day? Here's an example we love from Apple.

# ⚖️ Values

<aside>
💡 **Notion Tip:** It's great to have a set of qualities that define the way you want to work. Here's an example we like from the good folks at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture).

</aside>

## **Move with urgency and focus**

Our users entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. Millions of businesses around the world (individuals, startups, and large enterprises) are open for business only if we are. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously.

## **Think rigorously**

We care about being right and it often takes reasoning from first principles to get there.

## **Trust and amplify**

By the standards of the rest of the world, we overtrust. We’re okay with that.

## **Global optimization**

Stripes do what’s best for the organization overall.

## **The Stripe service**

Through the tools that we build, we want to push the world to create better products and services.

## **Optimism**

We are micro pessimists but macro optimists.
