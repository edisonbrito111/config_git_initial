# Vacation accrual

- **Q: Will my unused vacation days carry over to the following year?**
    
    A: ****Unused days *can* be carried over into the following year. While we encourage you to get out of the office and refresh, we won't penalize you for showing up to work ðŸ˜‰
    
- **Q: As a new employee, will my vacation days be prorated?**
    
    A: Yes. The number of personal days will be adjusted based on your start date. Sick days and holidays will not be affected.
    
- **Q: If I leave the company, will I be compensated for unused days?**
    
    A: Yes. You will receive a check compensating you for any unused *personal* days. Sick days and holidays will not be reimbursed.
